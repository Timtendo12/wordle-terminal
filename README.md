Wordle but in your cozy terminal? HELL YES!




This wordle-version has been made with a english word txt file from another github rep. It has over 20K 5 letter words. Some of them are pretty weird. Like CSVIR. While it is indeed 5 letters it is a 
abbreviation. I dont wanna go over every one of the 20K words to pick them out but I will make it possible to report these words so I can delete them from the wordslist. If you have any word that you 
want to add. No worries its there its up to you to stay up to 5AM finding that word and not realizing what the hell you are doing with your life? (Dont worry for the P-word its worth it <3). If you look 
at my code and see something that can be done better. PLEASE make a request. Not only will it help me but also all the other young developers that just want to learn. We can all learn from each other 
through Github and I would love to help with that!




(Also if you play this at work, get caught and your boss aint happy...You have a shitty boss. But no worries. Maybe i'll make a undercover mode so it looks like you are coding and debugging from the 
console but instead you are playing your favourite terminal game :D).


If only I had a girlfriend to make this for. So this is made for you, Lucky girl I get to marry in the future!
